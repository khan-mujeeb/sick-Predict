## üë®‚ÄçüíªTech Stack

The app is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): Kotlin is the primary programming language used for developing the application.
- [Retrofit](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room): Room is used as the local database to store the history of scanned QR codes.
- [Firebase](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html): Coroutines are used for handling asynchronous operations such as network requests and database transactions.
- [Gemini Api](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/code-scanner): The app utilizes the Google Code Scanner library for scanning and decoding QR codes.
- [MVVM Architecture](): MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural pattern that separates the concerns of data presentation and business logic from the UI components.
